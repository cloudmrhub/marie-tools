## ⚙️ **Repository Structure**

### **1. 📇 `src/` — Core Source Code**

| Subfolder                 | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src_geometry/`           | Parsers for GMSH surface and wire coil formats|
| `src_integral_equations/` | Implements all integral formulations: **WIE**, **SIE**, **VIE**, **WVIE**, **SVIE**, and **WSVIE**|
| `src_solver/`             | Iterative solvers (**GMRES**) with support for **block-Jacobi** and **LU preconditioning**, GPU acceleration.|
| `src_mathematics/`        | Tensor decompositions (**SVD**, **Tucker**, **Tensor Train**) and **Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA)** for matrix compression.|
| `src_physics/`            | Computation of electromagnetic fields and SNR. Electronic simulator.|
| `src_utils/`              | General utilities for file I/O, `.json` parsing, and data management.|

### **2. 🔌 `src_runners/` — Simulation Entry Points**

Each runner is a self-contained script that performs geometry assembly, matrix construction, system solution, and post-processing.

| Runner           | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MARIE_runner.m` | Executes the full **WSVIE** simulation.                                                     |
| `BASIS_runner.m` | Generates an **elcectromangetic basis**, **UISNR** or the **ideal current patterns**, and the **MRGF**|
| `MRGF_runner.m`  | Runs the **MRGF-based reduced-order WSVIE** for faster simulations                 |
| `TMD_runner.m`   | Performs **automated tuning, matching, decoupling, preamplifier decoupling, and detuning** optimization of receive, transmit, and transceive coils (and their combinations) based on pre-computed Y parameters with external solvers (co-simulation is also performed for MARIE and MRGF runners by default)|

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. Install MATLAB R2023a or later.
2. **GMSH** (2.85) is provided with the repository (2.8.5).
3. Clone the repository and initialize:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudmrhub/marie-tools
   cd MARIE
   ```
4. From MATLAB to install all c++ routines
   ```
   startup.m
   installer.m
   ```
5. Run your first simulation:

   ```matlab
   MARIE_runner
   ```

   Input parameters are defined in `/data/inputs/`.
